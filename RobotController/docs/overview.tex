\section{Robot Brain}
The robot brain is the main class managing all the components of the robot.
The main cycle of the robot is inside this class.

\section{Learning Algorithms}
There is a general interface that is for every learning algorithm. It consists 
of
\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb|next_evaluation()|
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RLPowerAlgorithm}
The \emph{RLPowerAlgorithm} is an implmenetation of the Learning Algorithm. It
stands for \emph{Reinfoced Learning Power Algorithm}.

%TODO explaining how this algorithm works

Here is an example on how it works: %TODO

\section{Controllers}
This is interpreting the output of the learning algorithm and sending the 
signals to the servos.

\section{Servos}
This is taking the control input for the servo and sending it to the hardware.
